# Measuring ideology via word embeddings

This project is exploring the use of word embeddings to measure ideology.
For my test case I'm using twitter data from US congress members as well as the Russian Troll Tweet Dataset found here: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/russian-troll-tweets

## To do:
0. Configure environment

    - [x] Init git repo
    - [ ] init remote repo
    - [ ] set up virtual env
    - [x] Create README.md
    

1. Get list of all congess members
    - [x] Get keys and access tokens
    - [x] Put keys/tokens in a file
    - [ ] pull cspan list: https://twitter.com/cspan/lists/members-of-congress/members?lang=en


2. scrape meta data for congress members

    - [ ] Fields: screen name, user id, about, party, gender, district


3. Get troll data
